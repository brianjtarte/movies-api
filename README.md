# LAB - Class 32

## About
 - Features - Django REST Framework
   - Make your site a DRF powered API as you did in previous lab.
   - Adjust project’s permissions so that only authenticated user’s have access to API.
   - Add a custom permission so that only appropriate users can update or delete it.
   - Exactly what this means will depend on your application, so if you have any questions about “appropriate users” means reach out to TA/Instructor.
   - Add ability to switch user’s directly from browsable API.
   - Features - Docker
 - NOTE Refer to demo for built out Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml examples.
   - create Dockerfile based off python:3.10-slim
   - create docker-compose.yml to run Django app as a web service.
   - enter docker-compose up --build to start your site.
   - add postgres as a service
